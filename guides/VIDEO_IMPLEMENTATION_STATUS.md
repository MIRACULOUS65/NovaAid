# Video Call Implementation - Final Status

## ✅ What's Been Implemented

### 1. Backend Video Routes (`/BACKEND/novaaid-app-backend/routes/video.js`)
- **POST `/api/video/create`** - Creates Daily.co rooms and meeting tokens
- **DELETE `/api/video/delete/:roomName`** - Deletes Daily.co rooms
- Authentication middleware integrated
- Role-based access control (user/ngo only)
- Firestore permission checks for resource access

### 2. Frontend Components

#### User Portal (`/FRONTEND/novaaid-app/app/video/room/[roomName]/page.tsx`)
- VideoRoomClient component with Daily.co integration
- Full video interface with controls
- Participant grid layout
- Screen sharing support
- Chat functionality
- Leave meeting functionality

#### NGO Portal (`/FRONTEND/NGO SECTION/ngo-portal/app/video/room/[roomName]/page.tsx`)
- Identical video room implementation for NGOs
- Same features as user portal
- Role-specific branding possible

### 3. Daily.co Configuration
- API integration via `@daily-co/daily-js`
- Room creation with proper settings:
  - ✅ Video/audio enabled by default
  - ✅ Screen sharing enabled
  - ✅ Chat enabled
  - ❌ Recording disabled (requires paid plan)
- Meeting token generation with 1-hour expiry
- Secure authentication through Clerk

---

## 🔧 Key Configuration

### Environment Variables Required
```env
DAILY_API_KEY=your_daily_co_api_key
DAILY_BASE_URL=https://api.daily.co
```

### Daily.co Account Requirements
- ⚠️ **Payment method must be added to Daily.co account**
- Even free tier requires card on file
- Free tier includes:
  - 10,000 participant minutes/month
  - Unlimited rooms
  - Up to 20 participants per room

---

## 🚨 Known Issues & Solutions

### Issue: "account-missing-payment-method"
**Cause:** Daily.co requires payment method on file, even for free accounts

**Solution:**
1. Go to https://dashboard.daily.co/
2. Navigate to Settings → Billing
3. Add a credit/debit card (won't be charged on free tier)
4. Wait 2-3 minutes for activation
5. Refresh video page and try again

### Issue: "enable_recording cannot be set"
**Status:** ✅ FIXED
**Solution:** Removed `enable_recording` property from room creation (requires paid plan)

### Issue: Role check blocking access
**Status:** ✅ IMPLEMENTED
**Details:** Role check is active. Ensure Clerk users have `activeRole` set to either 'user' or 'ngo' in public metadata.

## 🧹 Cleanup Completed

### Removed Test Code
- ❌ Emoji logging (🎬📡🔑) from room creation
- ❌ Test route `/api/video/test`
- ❌ Debug console.log statements
- ❌ Temporary test documentation files
  - `DAILY_API_TEST.md`
  - `READY_TO_TEST.md`
  - `FIX_DAILY_ROOM_ERROR.md`

### Kept Production Code
- ✅ Error logging (console.error for debugging)
- ✅ Role validation
- ✅ Permission checks
- ✅ Core video functionality
