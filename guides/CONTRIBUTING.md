## Development Setup

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+
- Git
- MetaMask
- Firebase account
- Clerk account

### Initial Setup

## Coding Standards

### JavaScript/TypeScript
- Use TypeScript for all new frontend code
- Follow ESLint configuration
- Use meaningful variable names
- Add JSDoc comments for functions
- Prefer `const` over `let`, avoid `var`

**Example:**
```typescript
/**
 * Generates a Semaphore identity commitment
 * @param salt - Random 256-bit salt
 * @returns Commitment hash as hex string
 */
async function generateCommitment(salt: string): Promise<string> {
  // Implementation
}
```

### Solidity
- Follow Solidity style guide
- Use OpenZeppelin contracts when possible
- Add NatSpec comments
- Optimize for gas efficiency
- Always include tests

**Example:**
```solidity
/**
 * @notice Pay verification fee to become verified
 * @dev Requires exactly 0.01 CELO payment
 */
function payVerificationFee() external payable {
    require(msg.value == verificationFee, "Invalid fee amount");
    // Implementation
}
```

### Commit Messages
Follow conventional commits format:

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>

<footer>
```

**Types:**
- `feat` - New feature
- `fix` - Bug fix
- `docs` - Documentation changes
- `style` - Code style changes
- `refactor` - Code refactoring
- `test` - Adding tests
- `chore` - Maintenance tasks

**Examples:**
