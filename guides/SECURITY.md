# Security Policy

## 🔒 Security Overview

NovaAid takes security seriously. This document outlines our security policy, how to report vulnerabilities, and best practices for contributors and users.

## 🛡️ Supported Versions

## 🚨 Reporting a Vulnerability

### Critical Vulnerabilities

If you discover a security vulnerability that could:
- Compromise user funds
- Expose private keys or sensitive data
- Allow unauthorized access to admin functions
- Bypass authentication or authorization
- Enable contract exploits

**DO NOT** open a public issue!

### How to Report

**Preferred Method - Private Disclosure:**
1. Email: security@novaaid.org (if configured)
2. Subject: `[SECURITY] Brief description`
3. Include:
   - Vulnerability description
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Potential impact
   - Suggested fix (if any)
   - Your contact information

**Alternative Method:**
- GitHub Security Advisory: https://github.com/MIRACULOUS65/NovaAid/security/advisories/new

### Response Time

- **Critical vulnerabilities:** Response within 24 hours
- **High severity:** Response within 48 hours
- **Medium/Low severity:** Response within 1 week

### Disclosure Policy

- We will acknowledge your report within 24-48 hours
- We will provide a detailed response within 7 days
- We will work on a fix and keep you updated
- We will credit you in our security acknowledgments (unless you prefer to remain anonymous)
- We will coordinate public disclosure after the fix is deployed

## 🔐 Security Best Practices

### For Users

#### Wallet Security
- ✅ Never share your private keys or seed phrase
- ✅ Use hardware wallets for large amounts
- ✅ Verify contract addresses before transactions
- ✅ Double-check transaction details in MetaMask
- ✅ Keep your wallet software updated

#### Account Security
- ✅ Use strong, unique passwords
- ✅ Enable two-factor authentication (when available)
- ✅ Be cautious of phishing attempts
- ✅ Verify URLs before entering credentials
- ✅ Log out when using shared computers

#### Privacy Protection
- ✅ Never share your Semaphore identity salt
- ✅ Clear browser data regularly
- ✅ Use private browsing for sensitive operations
- ✅ Be aware of what data you're sharing in video calls

### For Developers

#### Smart Contract Development
- ✅ Follow OpenZeppelin best practices
- ✅ Use ReentrancyGuard for functions with external calls
- ✅ Implement access control (Ownable, roles)
- ✅ Add emergency pause mechanisms
- ✅ Write comprehensive tests (aim for >90% coverage)
- ✅ Get external audits before mainnet deployment
- ✅ Use static analysis tools (Slither, MythX)

#### Backend Development
- ✅ Validate all user inputs
- ✅ Use parameterized queries (prevent injection)
- ✅ Implement rate limiting
- ✅ Sanitize error messages (don't leak sensitive info)
- ✅ Use HTTPS in production
- ✅ Keep dependencies updated
- ✅ Use environment variables for secrets
- ✅ Implement proper authentication/authorization
- ✅ Log security events (but not sensitive data)

#### Frontend Development
- ✅ Never store private keys or sensitive data
- ✅ Validate user inputs client-side
- ✅ Use Content Security Policy headers
- ✅ Implement CSRF protection
- ✅ Sanitize data before rendering
- ✅ Use secure communication (HTTPS, WSS)
- ✅ Keep npm packages updated
- ✅ Run `npm audit` regularly

## 🔍 Known Security Considerations

### Current Limitations

#### Smart Contracts
- ⚠️ **Not Audited**: Smart contracts have not undergone external security audit
- ⚠️ **Testnet Only**: Currently deployed on Alfajores testnet, not production-ready
- ⚠️ **Owner Key Security**: Contract owner has significant privileges

#### Backend
- ⚠️ **API Rate Limiting**: Not yet implemented (planned for v1.1)
- ⚠️ **CAPTCHA**: Not implemented on public endpoints
- ⚠️ **Advanced DDoS Protection**: Relies on hosting provider

#### Frontend
- ⚠️ **Browser Storage**: Semaphore salt stored in localStorage (can be cleared)
- ⚠️ **Session Management**: Sessions handled by Clerk (third-party)

### Planned Security Enhancements

#### v1.1 (Q4 2025)
- [ ] API rate limiting implementation
- [ ] CAPTCHA on sensitive endpoints
- [ ] Enhanced input validation
- [ ] Automated security testing in CI/CD

#### v1.2 (Q1 2026)
- [ ] External smart contract audit
- [ ] Penetration testing
- [ ] Bug bounty program
- [ ] Two-factor authentication
- [ ] Hardware wallet support

#### v2.0 (2027)
- [ ] Multi-sig wallet for contract ownership
- [ ] Decentralized governance
- [ ] Advanced monitoring and alerting
- [ ] Incident response automation

5. **Document everything** - Logs, timestamps, actions taken
6. **Follow instructions** - Wait for guidance from maintainers

### For Maintainers

**Immediate Actions (0-1 hour):**
1. Acknowledge the report
2. Assess severity (Critical/High/Medium/Low)
3. Assemble response team
4. If critical: Pause smart contract if possible
5. If critical: Take affected services offline

**Short-term Actions (1-24 hours):**
1. Investigate and confirm vulnerability
2. Develop and test fix
3. Prepare communication for users
4. Deploy fix to staging environment
5. Test thoroughly

**Medium-term Actions (24-72 hours):**
1. Deploy fix to production
2. Monitor for exploitation attempts
3. Notify affected users (if any)
4. Update security documentation
5. Conduct post-mortem

**Long-term Actions (1-4 weeks):**
1. Implement additional safeguards
2. Update testing procedures
