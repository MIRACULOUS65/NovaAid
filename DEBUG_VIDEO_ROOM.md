# Debug Video Room "Only user or ngo may create/join rooms" Error

## üîç Step-by-Step Debugging

### Step 1: Verify You Saved the Metadata
Go back to Clerk Dashboard and check:
1. Go to Users
2. Click on your user
3. Click Metadata tab
4. Public metadata should show:
```json
{
  "activeRole": "user"
}
```
or
```json
{
  "activeRole": "ngo"
}
```

### Step 2: SIGN OUT COMPLETELY (MOST IMPORTANT!)
**This is the #1 reason it doesn't work after adding metadata!**

#### For User Portal:
1. Go to: http://localhost:3000
2. Click **Logout** button in sidebar
3. **Close ALL browser tabs** for localhost:3000
4. **Clear cookies** (Ctrl+Shift+Delete) ‚Üí Check "Cookies" ‚Üí Clear
5. Open fresh tab: http://localhost:3000
6. Sign in again

#### For NGO Portal:
1. Go to: http://localhost:3002
2. Click **Logout** button in sidebar
3. **Close ALL browser tabs** for localhost:3002
4. **Clear cookies** (Ctrl+Shift+Delete) ‚Üí Check "Cookies" ‚Üí Clear
5. Open fresh tab: http://localhost:3002
6. Sign in again

### Step 3: Check Backend Logs IMMEDIATELY
After signing in again, click Video Room and **immediately check your backend terminal**. You should see:

**‚úÖ SUCCESS - You should see:**
```
Verifying token...
Token verified successfully for user: user_xxxxx
User from token: {
  "sub": "user_xxxxx",
  "email": "...",
  "public_metadata": {
    "activeRole": "user"        ‚Üê THIS SHOULD BE HERE!
  },
  ...
}
User public_metadata: { activeRole: 'user' }
Current role found: user
```

**‚ùå FAILURE - If you see:**
```
User from token: {
  "sub": "user_xxxxx",
  "email": "...",
  "public_metadata": {},        ‚Üê EMPTY! This means old token
  ...
}
Current role found: undefined
Role check failed.
```

This means you're still using the old token. **You MUST sign out and clear cookies!**

### Step 4: Check Browser Console
Open browser console (Press F12), go to Console tab, and look for:

**‚úÖ If working:**
```
Successfully got room token
Successfully joined meeting
```

**‚ùå If not working:**
```
Video room error: { 
  status: 403, 
  data: { 
    error: 'Only user or ngo may create/join rooms',
    debug: {
      foundRole: undefined,
      availableKeys: [...]
    }
  } 
}
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Common Issues & Fixes

### Issue 1: "Still shows error after adding metadata"
**Cause**: Old token cached in browser
**Fix**: 
1. Sign out
2. Clear cookies (Ctrl+Shift+Delete)
3. Close all tabs
4. Sign in fresh

### Issue 2: "Metadata looks correct but not in token"
**Cause**: Metadata saved but token not refreshed
**Fix**:
1. In Clerk Dashboard, check metadata is saved
2. Sign out from portal
3. Wait 10 seconds
4. Sign in again

### Issue 3: "Wrong JSON format"
**Cause**: Typo in metadata
**Fix**: Must be EXACTLY this:
```json
{
  "activeRole": "user"
}
```
NOT:
- ‚ùå `{'activeRole': 'user'}` (single quotes)
- ‚ùå `{activeRole: "user"}` (no quotes on key)
- ‚ùå `{"role": "user"}` (wrong key name)
- ‚ùå `{"activeRole": "User"}` (capital U)

### Issue 4: "Set metadata for wrong user"
**Cause**: Multiple test accounts, updated wrong one
**Fix**:
1. In Clerk Dashboard ‚Üí Users
2. Find the EXACT email you're signing in with
3. Update that user's metadata
4. Sign out and in with that email

## üî¨ Advanced Debugging

### Check Token Contents Directly

1. After signing in, open browser console (F12)
2. Go to **Application** tab (Chrome) or **Storage** tab (Firefox)
3. Look for **Local Storage** ‚Üí `http://localhost:3000` (or 3002)
4. Find key like `__clerk_db_jwt` or similar
5. Copy the token value

Then decode it at: https://jwt.io/

Look for:
```json
{
  "sub": "user_xxx",
  "public_metadata": {
    "activeRole": "user"    ‚Üê Should be here!
  }
}
```

### Test API Directly

Open terminal and run:

```bash
# Replace YOUR_TOKEN with actual token from browser
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/video/create \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"roomName":"test-room-debug"}'
```

Check response. Should see room details, not error.

## üìû What to Share If Still Not Working

Please share these 3 things:

1. **Clerk Metadata Screenshot**
   - Show the Public metadata section

2. **Backend Terminal Output**
   - After clicking Video Room, copy the logs starting from:
   ```
   Verifying token...
   User from token: {...}
   ```

3. **Browser Console Error**
   - Press F12, go to Console tab

## üí° Most Likely Issue

**95% of the time it's this:**
You added the metadata correctly, but you're still using the OLD TOKEN from before you added it.

**The fix:**
1. Sign out
2. Wait 10 seconds  
3. Sign in again
4. Try video room

The NEW token will have the metadata!
