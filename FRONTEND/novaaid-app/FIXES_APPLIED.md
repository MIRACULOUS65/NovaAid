# Fixes Applied

## ✅ Issues Fixed

### 1. Homepage Now Public (No Login Required)
- ✅ **Before**: Clicking "Get Started" redirected to login
- ✅ **After**: Clicking "Get Started" goes directly to `/homepage`
- ✅ Users can browse homepage without authentication
- ✅ Updated `middleware.ts` to make `/homepage` a public route

### 2. Profile Button Behavior Corrected
- ✅ **Before**: Profile button behavior was unclear
- ✅ **After**: 
  - **Not signed in**: Clicking Profile → Opens Clerk sign-in modal
  - **Signed in**: Clicking Profile → Goes to `/profile` page
- ✅ This is the correct flow as requested

### 3. Firebase Configuration Updated
- ✅ Added proper Firebase client configuration
- ✅ Added environment variables for Firebase API key
- ✅ Created setup guide: `FIREBASE_SETUP_REQUIRED.md`

## 🔧 Files Modified

1. **middleware.ts**
   - Added `/homepage(.*)` to public routes
   - Homepage no longer requires authentication

2. **lib/firebase/client.ts**
   - Added proper Firebase config with API key
   - Uses environment variables

3. **.env**
   - Added `NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY`
   - Added `NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN`

## 📋 Current Flow

### User Journey (Not Signed In)
1. Visit landing page → Click "Get Started"
2. Redirected to `/homepage` ✅ (No login required)
3. Browse homepage freely
4. Click "Profile" in sidebar
5. Clerk sign-in modal opens
6. Sign in or sign up
7. Redirected to `/profile` page
8. User data synced to Firestore
9. Profile information displayed

### User Journey (Already Signed In)
1. Visit landing page → Click "Get Started"
2. Redirected to `/homepage`
3. Click "Profile" in sidebar
4. Redirected to `/profile` page ✅ (No login prompt)
5. Profile information displayed from Firestore
6. "Logout" button visible in sidebar

## ⚠️ Action Required

**You need to complete Firebase setup** to fix the Firestore connection error:

1. **Enable Firestore Database** in Firebase Console
2. **Get Web API Key** from Firebase Project Settings
3. **Update `.env` file** with the API key:
   ```env
   NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=AIzaSy... (your actual key)
   ```
4. **Restart dev server**: `npm run dev`

See `FIREBASE_SETUP_REQUIRED.md` for detailed instructions.

## 🧪 Testing

After Firebase setup, test the flow:

```bash
# Restart server
npm run dev

# Test flow:
1. Go to http://localhost:3000/landing
2. Click "Get Started" → Should go to /homepage (no login)
3. Click "Profile" in sidebar → Should open Clerk sign-in
4. Sign in
5. Should redirect to /profile with your data
6. "Logout" button should be visible
```

## 📊 Route Access

| Route | Access | Auth Required |
|-------|--------|---------------|
| `/` | Public | ❌ No |
| `/landing` | Public | ❌ No |
| `/homepage` | Public | ❌ No |
| `/profile` | Protected | ✅ Yes |
| `/sign-in` | Public | ❌ No |
| `/sign-up` | Public | ❌ No |

## 🔐 Authentication Behavior

- **Homepage**: Accessible without login, but Profile/Logout buttons behave differently based on auth state
- **Profile Button**: 
  - Not signed in → Opens sign-in modal
  - Signed in → Goes to profile page
- **Logout Button**: Only visible when user is signed in
- **Profile Page**: Requires authentication (middleware redirects if not signed in)

## Next Steps

1. Complete Firebase setup (see `FIREBASE_SETUP_REQUIRED.md`)
2. Test the authentication flow
3. Verify data is being stored in Firestore
4. Set up Clerk webhook for automatic user sync (optional but recommended)
