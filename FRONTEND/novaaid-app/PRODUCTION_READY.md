## 🔒 Security Best Practices

### ✅ Implemented
- Environment variables for secrets
- Server-side API routes for sensitive operations
- Firebase Admin SDK for secure database access
- Clerk for authentication
- No client-side secrets exposed

### ⚠️ Recommendations for Production
1. **Enable Firestore Security Rules**
   ```javascript
   rules_version = '2';
   service cloud.firestore {
     match /databases/{database}/documents {
       match /users/{userId} {
         allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
       }
     }
   }
   ```

2. **Use Production Clerk Keys**
   - Replace development keys with production keys
   - Configure production domain in Clerk dashboard

3. **Enable CORS Protection**
   - Configure allowed origins in Vercel
   - Set up proper CORS headers

4. **Add Rate Limiting**
   - Implement rate limiting on API routes
   - Use Vercel Edge Config for rate limits

## 📊 Monitoring & Logging

### What's Logged (Production)
- ✅ Critical errors only
- ✅ Authentication failures
- ✅ Database sync errors
- ❌ No debug information
- ❌ No sensitive data
- ❌ No environment variables

### Recommended Monitoring
