# Authentication Implementation Summary

## ✅ Completed Features

### 1. Clerk Authentication Integration
- ✅ Installed `@clerk/nextjs` package
- ✅ Configured ClerkProvider in root layout

- ✅ Set up environment variables with Clerk keys

### 2. Firebase Firestore Integration
- ✅ Installed `firebase` and `firebase-admin` packages
- ✅ Created Firebase Admin SDK configuration (`lib/firebase/admin.ts`)
- ✅ Created Firebase Client SDK configuration (`lib/firebase/client.ts`)
- ✅ Set up environment variables with Firebase credentials

### 3. User Data Synchronization
- ✅ **Webhook Endpoint** (`/api/webhooks/clerk`): Automatically syncs users when Clerk events occur
  - Handles `user.created` events
  - Handles `user.updated` events
  - Handles `user.deleted` events

- ✅ **Logout Button**: 
  - Hidden when user is not signed in
  - Visible only when user is authenticated
  - Logs out user and redirects to landing page

### 6. Route Protection

- ✅ Protected routes: `/homepage`, `/profile`
- ✅ Middleware automatically redirects unauthenticated users

## 🔐 Authentication Flow

### Sign In Flow
1. User clicks **Profile** button in sidebar (not signed in)
2. Clerk sign-in modal opens
3. User signs in or creates account
4. Webhook fires → User data synced to Firestore
5. User redirected back to homepage
6. Logout button now visible in sidebar

### Profile Access Flow
1. User clicks **Profile** button (signed in)
2. Redirected to `/profile` page
3. User data synced to Firestore (if needed)
4. User data fetched from Firestore
5. Profile information displayed

### Logout Flow
1. User clicks **Logout** button
2. Clerk signs out user
3. Redirected to `/landing` page
4. Logout button hidden

## 📊 Firestore Data Structure

```typescript
Collection: users
Document ID: {clerkUserId}
{
  clerkId: string;
  email: string;
  firstName: string;
  lastName: string;
  username: string;
  imageUrl: string;
  createdAt: string; // ISO timestamp
  updatedAt: string; // ISO timestamp
}
```

## 🚀 Next Steps

### Required Setup
1. **Configure Clerk Webhook** (Recommended):
   - Go to Clerk Dashboard → Webhooks
   - Add endpoint: `https://your-domain.com/api/webhooks/clerk`
   - Subscribe to: `user.created`, `user.updated`, `user.deleted`
   - Copy signing secret to `.env` as `CLERK_WEBHOOK_SECRET`

2. **Enable Firestore**:
   - Go to Firebase Console
   - Enable Firestore Database
   - Set up security rules (optional for development)

3. **Deploy Application**:
   - Deploy to Vercel/Netlify
   - Add environment variables to deployment platform
   - Update webhook URL in Clerk dashboard

### Optional Enhancements
- Add user profile editing functionality
- Implement user settings page
- Add more user fields (phone, address, etc.)
- Set up Firestore security rules
- Add user role management
- Implement email verification checks

## 🧪 Testing

To test the implementation:

```bash
# Start development server
npm run dev

# Visit http://localhost:3000
# 1. Go to /homepage
# 2. Click Profile button (should open Clerk sign-in)
# 3. Sign up or sign in
# 4. Check Firestore for user data
# 5. Click Profile button again (should go to /profile)
# 6. Verify all data displays correctly
# 7. Click Logout (should sign out and redirect)
```

## ✨ Build Status

✅ **Build Successful** - No TypeScript errors
✅ **All routes compiled** - Static and dynamic routes working
✅ **Middleware configured** - Route protection active

## 📝 Notes

- The app uses both webhook and manual sync for reliability
- Profile page automatically syncs user data on visit
- Logout button only appears when user is authenticated
- All sensitive credentials are in `.env` file (not committed to git)
- Firebase Admin SDK runs server-side only
- Firebase Client SDK used for client-side data fetching
