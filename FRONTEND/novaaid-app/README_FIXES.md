# ✅ Fixes Applied - Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ "Get Started" Button No Longer Requires Login
**Before**: Clicking "Get Started" redirected to Clerk login  
**After**: Clicking "Get Started" goes directly to `/homepage` without authentication

**What Changed**:
- Updated `middleware.ts` to make `/homepage` a public route
- Users can now browse the homepage without signing in

### 2. ✅ Profile Button Redirects to Login (When Not Signed In)
**Before**: Unclear behavior  
**After**: 
- **Not signed in**: Click Profile → Opens Clerk sign-in modal
- **Signed in**: Click Profile → Goes to `/profile` page with user data

**What Changed**:
- Profile button in sidebar now checks authentication state
- Uses Clerk's `openSignIn()` when user is not authenticated
- Navigates to `/profile` when user is authenticated

### 3. ✅ Logout Button Only Shows When Signed In
**Before**: Always visible  
**After**: Hidden when not signed in, visible only when authenticated

**What Changed**:
- Added conditional rendering: `{isSignedIn && <LogoutButton />}`
- Logout button only appears in sidebar when user is authenticated

## 🎯 Current User Flow

```

### Flow 2: Returning User (Already Signed In)

## ⚠️ Important: Firebase Setup Required

The Firestore database needs to be enabled to store user data. Follow these steps:

### Quick Setup (5 minutes)

2. **Select Project**: nova-aid-43305
3. **Enable Firestore**:
   - Click "Firestore Database" in left sidebar
   - Click "Create Database"
   - Choose "Test mode" for development
   - Click "Enable"

4. **Get API Key**:
   - Click ⚙️ Settings → Project Settings
   - Scroll to "Your apps" section
   - If no web app exists, click "Add app" → Web
   - Copy the `apiKey` value

5. **Update .env file**:
   ```env
   NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=AIzaSy... (paste your key here)
   ```

6. **Restart server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

**Detailed instructions**: See `FIREBASE_SETUP_REQUIRED.md`
